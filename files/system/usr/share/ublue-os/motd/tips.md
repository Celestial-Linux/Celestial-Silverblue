The cake is a lie.
We just got the results from that last test: You are a horrible person. That's what it says. A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
Wowser
Everything is a picture waiting to be taken
Everybody pretends to care until they don't
and the universe said I love you because you are love.
and the universe said you are stronger than you know
You. You. You are alive.
and the universe said you are not alone
And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.
